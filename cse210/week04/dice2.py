# reptition - iteration is a kind of repititon which

# Creating random values using Pythonâ€™s random module
#   random module is used to simulate rolling a 6 sided dice 
#   using random.randint(1,6) Gets a random integer in the 
#   range [a, b] including both end points.
# Python comparison operators
