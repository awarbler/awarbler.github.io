    <!-- Let's put these new elements into action.First of all, make a local 
    copy of spending-record.html and minimal-table.css in a new folder.Try 
    opening it in a browser — You'll see that it looks OK, but it could 
    stand to be improved. The "SUM" row that contains a summation of the 
    spent amounts seems to be in the wrong place, and there are some detail
    missing from the code.Put the obvious headers row inside a <thead> 
    element, the "SUM" row inside a <tfoot> element, and the rest of the 
    content inside a <tbody> element.Save and refresh, and you'll see that 
    adding the <tfoot> element has caused the "SUM" row to go down to the 
    bottom of the table.Next, add a colspan attribute to make the "SUM" cell 
    span across the first four columns, so the actual number appears at the 
    bottom of the "Cost" column.Let's add some simple extra styling to the 
    table, to give you an idea of how useful these elements are for applying 
    CSS. Inside the head of your HTML document, you'll see an empty <style> 
        element. Inside this element, add the following lines of CSS code: -->
        <h1>My spending record</h1>
    
          <table>
            <caption>How I chose to spend my money</caption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Purchase</th>
                <th>Location</th>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Evaluation</th>
                <th>Cost (€)</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tfoot>
              <tr>
                <td colspan="4">SUM</td>

              </tr>
            </tfoot>

              </tr>
